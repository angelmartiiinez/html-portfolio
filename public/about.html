<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I am Angel Martinez, a 22-year-old with a passion for creating and learning!
  I graduated from a community college, where I earned an Associates of Science degree. 
  I wanted to continue my education but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. 
  I started a T-shirt business as a side hustle. I needed a website for my business. I found someone to make me a website, but I wasn't satisfied with it. 
  I wanted to change the website to my liking but I didn't know how. I had to learn and that is how I started my journey in Web Development.
  This experience ignited my enthusiasm for technology, pushing me to further my education at WGU.
  I am currently working on obtaining my Bachelor's in Software Engineering.

  <p>Professionally, I am currently a store manager at a bakery. Leading a team and creating a welcoming customer experience is rewarding.
  I am a self-taught baker. My venture into baking began as a personal passion and evolved into a successful at-home bakery. 
  It's so fullfilling to witness the joy my creations bring to others.
  I'm also a dog sitter and have many regulars whom I dog sit for on multiple occasions. Being around animals is such a heart warming experience.</p> 

  <p>Life is an exciting journey, and I'm determined to make the most of it, fueled by my passions and driven by the desire to leave a positive mark.</p>
